# Passing tests

Practice of your testing knowlege and JavaScript coding skills by analysing an existing test suite & writing functions to ensure the successful passage of all tests. 

## Organisation

### Duration

You have **2 hours** to make as much progress on this task as possible.

### Team

Pairs of students

### Set-up

**Run** `npm install` from this folder to install all necessary libraries.

## Brief

This folder contains a `package.json` set-up to run unit tests on code files. At the moment, the tests are all failing as the code files - and the functions that should be in them - do not exist.

Your task is to make the tests pass by implementing the necessary functions in the following files:
- `numberFunctions.js`
- `stringFunctions.js`

This will involve navigating an unfamiliar project, research, and using existing knowledge of Javascript syntax.

## Guidance

- You will need to write code within existing files to complete this task
- Do not edit the test files or the `package.json`
- There are NPM scripts that will run the tests (wholly or partially)
- Start by working on the tests in `numberFunctions.js`; the ones in `stringFunctions.js` are harder
- Reading the test code might be helpful, but it's not required - the console output from the tests should be able to guide you
- You may need to do some research to get the string tests to pass
